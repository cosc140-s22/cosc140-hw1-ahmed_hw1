                        The country of Wales has some devolved powers from the
                        UK Government. This allows them control over their
                        cultural, education, health, and the environment to name
                        a few.

                        <br />
                        These laws are decided by the 60 Member of the Senedd
                        (MS). Even though the vote to give Wales devolved powers
                        was a very narrow decision, many Welsh citizens still
                        strive for more control over their nation such as
                        control over their justice system. But there are also
                        some people in Wales who wish to see greater unity with
                        England.

                        Brought to Wales from England, Rugby has grown to be one
                        of the most popular sport in Wales alongside football.
                        Welsh victories over teir rival nations, including
                        England, has given Wales a spirit of national identity
                        around Rugby.

                      <p>
                        Wales is the country of castles. With a long history of
                        war and conquest, from the Normans to the English,
                        castles are an everpresent historic relic in Wales.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Many of these castles and ruins were destroyed over the
                        years but there has been a movement to revie and rebuild
                        Welsh history, and many of these historical sites have
                        seen restoration.

            <h1>My Time In Wales</h1>
            <p>
              I've enjoyed my time in Wales so far. <br />
              So far, I've visited some castles, explored downtown Cardiff,
              visited the Senedd, etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm hoping to go to a rugby game, a football game, and explore
              other countries in the UK and Europe during my time here.
